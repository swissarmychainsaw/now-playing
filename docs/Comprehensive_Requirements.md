## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for the "Now Playing" movie application, a platform that helps users discover, explore, and find where to watch movies.

### 1.2 Project Overview
The application integrates with The Movie Database (TMDb) to provide movie information, streaming availability, and personalized recommendations. It offers a clean, responsive interface for browsing, searching, and interacting with movie content.

### 1.2.1 Authentication and Access Control

The application uses Google Authentication via Firebase as the sole method for user login. No other authentication providers (e.g. email/password, phone) are enabled.
Implementation Overview

    Google-only Sign-In is enforced via Firebase Auth.

    On first login, a user profile is created and may be extended in Firestore.

    Authentication state is tracked globally and governs access to app routes.

    Sessions persist using Firebaseâ€™s native token and refresh system.

Authenticated Pages

The following pages require the user to be signed in:

    Landing Page (Main Recommendation View): Users enter a favorite movie and receive recommendations.

    Movie Detail Page: Provides detailed metadata about a selected movie.

    User Ratings Page: Displays all movies the user has interacted with via thumbs up/down.

Unauthenticated Pages

The following pages do not require authentication:

    Test Pages (e.g. /test-cards, /test-layouts): Used during development for previewing components such as movie cards or layout structure.

    404 / Fallback Page: Displayed for unknown routes.
